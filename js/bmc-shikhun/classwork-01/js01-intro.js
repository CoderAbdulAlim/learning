/**
 * => JavaScript Introduction
JavaScript is a widely-used programming language that brings interactivity and dynamism to web pages. Originally created for web development, it has since expanded its reach to various domains, including server-side scripting, mobile apps, and games. JavaScript's real-time content manipulation, seamless HTML/CSS integration, and extensive ecosystem of libraries make it an essential tool in modern web development.

=> JavaScript History
JavaScript has a rich history that dates back to its creation by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995. Originally named "LiveScript," it was later renamed JavaScript to capitalize on the popularity of Java at the time. JavaScript was primarily designed to add interactivity to web pages and quickly became a vital component of web development. In 1997, it was standardized as ECMAScript, ensuring cross-browser compatibility. Over the years, JavaScript has evolved significantly, with the introduction of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) bringing major enhancements to the language. Today, JavaScript is a cornerstone of web development, powering everything from complex web applications to server-side scripting and even mobile app development through frameworks like Node.js and React Native.

// A high-level definition (From mozill.org)
/**
 * JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

// From wikipedia
/**
 * JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users‘ devices.

JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

JavaScript is the Programming Language for the Web.

JavaScript can update and change both HTML and CSS.

JavaScript can calculate, manipulate and validate data.

A brife history https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript

from geeksforgeeks  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/history-of-javascript/

Brendan Eich first developed JavaScript, a computer language, in about ten days in May 1995. The language, formerly known as Mocha, later modified to LiveScript, and is now known simply as JavaScript, was created to be used on the client-side of websites, enabling the addition of dynamic and interactive components to static HTML texts.

JavaScript was initially implemented in Netscape Navigator, which was the most popular browser at the time. The language was quickly adopted by Microsoft for use in Internet Explorer. Due to its simplicity of usage and the fact that it was the only client-side scripting language available at the time, JavaScript quickly gained popularity among web developers.

JavaScript gained popularity during the ensuing years and was used to develop a wide range of web applications, such as online games, dynamic menus, and form validation. ECMAScript 4, a new version of the language, was planned in 2002, however, it was ultimately abandoned because of conflicts among the various browser vendors.

With an estimated 95% of websites utilizing it in some capacity, JavaScript is currently one of the most popular programming languages in use worldwide. It is employed not only in web development but also in the creation of server-side applications, desktop and mobile applications, and even the programming of robots and other hardware.
